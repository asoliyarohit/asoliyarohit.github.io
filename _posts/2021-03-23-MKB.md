Today's day was such a pain. I couldn't do anything apart from the chapter 2 of the book.
Didn't go to the gym, didn't read the 25 pages..

SHould I enroll for UPSC to test my knowledge? It'll be fun to work for the country maybe... never really thought about it.

Linkedin is such a weird depressing place, seems like every other person is way way wayyyyy ahead of me in life from the relative standpoint. I just wanna do something that makes me happy. Your daily 9 - 5 job expects to kill your soul and sell it to just pass by. I'm sorry won't happen, I have seen the worst, good is all I want and all I will work for.

Oh gotta start back on Hangul too, but until then... 


Danke!
