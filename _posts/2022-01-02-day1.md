I'm 25 now, my whole life has been filled with failure so far. Have already had two major surguries, feel constantly anxious and unhealthy, didn't get into the college I wanted, feel like if I do study too I'll just fail at things, don't have any savings whatsoever and I just constantly feel that I don't know shit and someone will randomly stop me and go haha caught ya!

I'll try to turn this shit around in this year. If you have read the previous posts they all are in similar stride, but yeah you guessed it right I was always weak to quit in the begining it self.

Breaking things into 3 Categories

- Makes me better
