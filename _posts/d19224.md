I have rather gotten poor on all 3 fronts lately. Academic, Health and Financial. Feel like a clown for not gettting my shit together. Not your problem nor any sympathy run, but just thinking out loud like I would in my head. 

To tackle all the 3 above. I need to come up with a plan and execute in the next 100 days. 

Day - 0

Cheers!
